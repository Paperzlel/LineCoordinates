# LineGraph
 A linear sequence line finder and creator for graphs

## Using LineGraph
0.2 and lower are made with C++, later builds are with Python. As of updating, this currently does not have a general-use build that is a download-and-go option.
To run it, open up any Python compiler or IDE and select the "Run" option. 

## Features
Currently it has the ability to save and load a set of coordinates from a .txt file. You can even exit the application!

## TODO
I want to make this an incredible project, and with graphs there's a lot to use. I'll detail all the ones I want here for now:
1. Have a linear sequence decoder (find x, y, gradient, y-intercept)
2. Give support for other sequences (quadratic, cubic, reciprocal)
3. Visualise all this on a GUI
4. 3D support? Maybe separate

## Issues/Feedback
Want to help me out with the project? Leave an issue or make a PR if you have an issue. Feedback is always appreciated, and you can leave requests if there's anything you want to see in the project I haven't already stated!
