# LineCoordinates
 A linear sequence line finder and creator for graphs

## Usage
### Currently avaialble features:
 - can store 1 set of coordinates in the program
 - Can load them or replace them at any point

## TO-DO:
 - loading the coordinate set from storage
 - create 2 sets of coordinates and create a line sequence for them
 - Visualising the grpahs
 - Other sequences (quadratic, cubic, reciprocal, etc.)

## Building
needs C++ compiler, then run the .exe file it creates to use the program
